                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Synopsis:</strong> This project focuses on solving luggage handling inefficiencies in airports by designing and 
                    automating a luggage transportation system. The system uses a rotary actuator-driven platform to transfer 
                    luggage between a higher platform and a lower platform. The solution integrates mechanical and software 
                    components to scan barcodes, verify weight constraints, and sort luggage accordingly. The project aimed to improve
                    efficiency, reduce errors, and create a design for future airport applications. Included with this, our team was tasked
                    with creating a python program to take in passenger and fleet data and manipulate it to display required information. 
                </p>
   
                <p>
                    <strong>Assigned Constraints, Materials, and Mechanism:</strong> Our team was tasked with ensuring the system could handle luggage 
                    up to 5 kg, fit within specific size constraints, and function seamlessly under predefined weight and motion limitations. A rotary 
                    actuator was chosen as the core mechanism due to its precision and efficiency.

                        group, my primary contribution was focused on the software development for the project. I 
                        dedicated significant time to fine-tuning the coordinates and arm adjustments required for the
                        Q-Arm to efficiently pick up and drop off luggage at the designated locations. Furthermore, I 
                        ensured that all provided data files were correctly read and processed, verifying
                        that each group function performed as intended, ensuring seamless integration and overall 
                        functionality of the system.

                        <p> 
                            Our design process began with creating a detailed list of functions, objectives, and constraints. 
                            Building on this foundation, I developed a morph table inspired by Dr. Fleming's lectures. This method
                            proved highly effective for brainstorming and generating sketches, allowing us to clearly visualize 
                            how our mechanism would operate. During the process, I often questioned whether the selected means
                            chosen as a group were the best options or if alternatives were overlooked. For instance, would 
                            a more complex mechanism lead to better functionality, or would it add unnecessary complications? 
                            These discussions we had as a group solidified our understanding of the design but also helped ensure 
                            we create a efficient design for this problem.

                                Given here is a morph table, a crucial tool used in out design process. It was used to explore multiple 
                                design options for specific functions by listing possible solutions (means) and selecting the best ones
                                based on project objectives and constraints. This table was created by me and then discussed with the 
                                group to finalize our design. The Sliding Inner Platform was selected for seamless luggage transfer, 
                                as it uses gravity to extend and retract. These choices highlight 
                                the practicality and effectiveness of the morph table in narrowing down design solutions.

                                From our chosen means, our team developed a detailed sketch to visualize how the design 
                                would look before creating the CAD model in Autodesk Inventor. The sketch included descriptions
                                of key mechanisms, to ensure the design was clear and understandable to all team members. 
                                This step helped align the team on the overall concept and provided a solid foundation for translating 
                                the design into a functional CAD model.

                            Using the initial sketch and undergoing multiple refinements, our team frequently revisited 
                            the morph table to create additional sketches and re-evaluated the objectives to ensure the 
                            chosen means aligned with the project goals. After iterative improvements and discussions, the 
                            group finalized a design that utilized a rotary actuator to lower and raise a bridge for transferring 
                            luggage. This design built upon the individual CAD models contributed by team members, combining 
                            the best features into a functional final model.

                <p>
                The project featured a software component where we were tasked with interpreting large data files
                    containing fleet and passenger information. Our goal was to develop individual functions that processed 
                    this data and displayed it in a clear, table-like format. I played a significant role in this part of the
                    project, leveraging and refining my Python skills in parsing file data, manipulating datasets, and presenting
                    useful information visually using Turtle Graphics.
                </p>
                <p>
   
                    To approach this challenge effectively, I began by creating detailed flowcharts for each function. These flowcharts, 
                    along with well-structured pseudocode, laid the groundwork for the Python implementation. This 
                    approach made coding the functions straightforward, as the problem-solving and planning phases were
                    already completed. During this step, I considered questions such as 'is there an easier way to structure this function?'
                    or 'How can I reduce redundant operations?' An example is that initially in the flowchart, I was going through each 
                    list individually to output in turtle graphics. However,  I noticed all the lists were of the same size, meaning I 
                    needed to use only one list's length to iterate through them all, which made the code look more professional and executed 
                    faster.

                        Throughout our project, even after creating and refining sketches, 
                        the CAD models were not perfected on the first try. The process 
                        involved multiple iterations and revisions to address various 
                        challenges. I learned that CAD models provide a much clearer 
                        representation of the actual project, revealing potential issues 
                        that might not be evident in sketches. For instance, concerns like, 
                        "This won't fit, in the sliding mechanism" or "This doesn't align with 
                        our constraints and objectives, as it won't reach the second platform" 
                        frequently came up and were actively discussed with my group members. 
                        These collaborative discussions helped us identify and resolve design 
                        flaws, ensuring the final CAD model was both functional and aligned 
                        with the project's goals.

                                This was the first CAD model our group collectively agreed upon. After spending time
                                3D printing the design, we discovered that the rigid rod connected to the rotary actuator 
                                lacked the necessary flexibility, preventing it from functioning as intended. This 
                                unexpected limitation forced us to discard the idea and return to the morph table to reevaluate 
                                our approach and explore alternative solutions.

                                After many iterations, we finalized this design and 3D printed it as well. The rotary actuator 
                                and the string mechanism we purchased worked effectively to lower the bridge. However, raising 
                                the bridge only succeeded 50% of the time, forcing us to refine the CAD model to allow the 
                                sliding mechanism to move more freely. Additionally, we discovered that the luggage provided 
                                did not fit within the allocated space for entry from platform A. To resolve this, we adjusted 
                                the design by raising the rotary actuator, which became a key improvement in our final iteration.

                                In our final iteration, we addressed all the remaining challenges identified in previous designs. 
                                The sliding mechanism was refined further to ensure smooth and unrestricted movement, and the rotary 
                                actuator was elevated to provide clearance for the luggage to enter  from Platform A. This iteration 
                                incorporated all the adjustments required to meet the project objectives and constraints, resulting
                                in a fully functional design that successfully transported luggage as intended.

                        This project featured two final programs. The first, developed for the Quanser arm on a Raspberry Pi,
                        enabled the system to pick up and drop off luggage using our 3D-printed model. I calibrated the precise
                        coordinates for pickup, rejection, and platform areas, which required fine-tuning. To control the platform,
                        to address issues where the platform would not slide back down, I programmed the rotary actuator to spin
                        clockwise and counterclockwise, introducing a "jerking" motion with small time intervals to ensure the
                        platform slid back into its resting position smoothly.

                            to life through real-world interactions. This hands-on experience reinforced my passion for
                            engineering, challenged me to think critically about hardware-software integration. The hardware program allowed me to see the direct impact of my efforts,

                   This project pushed me out of my comfort zone and challenged me to think critically about
                    both the creative design process and the integration of hardware and software.  As a team,
                     we were optimistic at the start, thinking our first CAD model would work perfectly. However,
                    this was our first time creating CAD models, and we quickly realized that translating an 
                    idea into a functional design is far more complex it looks like. Our initial model, which
                    we were very confident about, failed during testing due to the rigidity of the rotary 
                    actuator connection, forcing us to go back to the drawing board and refine our design.
                    I learned about being patient and flexible in the testing and refining phase of our 
                    design project.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it came to the hardware integration and coding, I found the process rewarding yet
                    filled with challenges. One of the biggest hurdles was calibrating the rotary actuator
                    and fine-tuning the platform's motion to specific coordinates, particularly in getting
                    it to slide back to its resting position. Although I implemented a jittering motion
                    to address this, I couldn't help but question the scalability of our design. If this
                    were taken to the real world and scaled up for actual luggage sizes, I don't
                    believe the sliding mechanism would function as intended due to the physics
                    of larger, heavier models and the effects of gravity. This realization highlighted 
                    the importance of considering real-world constraints early in the design process.
                    Despite these challenges, seeing the system come to life and operate on this smaller 
                    scale was incredibly fulfilling. This project not only helped me develop technical 
                    skills but also taught me to think critically about scalability, functionality, and the 
                    real-world applications of my work that I will use in future projects.

                    For my final project in Grade 12 Computer Engineering, I created a hand gesture-controlled car equipped with 
                    a camera that streamed live footage to a connected smartphone. This project was inspired by my interest in 
                    autonomous driving and served as a stepping stone to understanding motors, sensors, and wireless technologies 
                    like Bluetooth. The rover's motion was controlled using an <strong> MPU6050 </strong>accelerometer to capture hand gestures, and 
                    commands were transmitted via an <strong>HC-05</strong> Bluetooth module to drive the rover's DC motors using an<strong>  L298N</strong> motor driver. 
                    The live video feed was enabled through a <strong> Raspberry Pi 4</strong>  paired with a Raspberry Pi camera module, showcasing my 
                    understanding of hardware integration and wireless communication.

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in wiring and connecting a variety of devices, 
                    debugging hardware issues, and integrating multiple technologies into a cohesive system. It allowed me 
                    to explore concepts like motor control, accelerometer data processing, and real-time video streaming. 
                    Working with components like the Raspberry Pi, Bluetooth modules, and motor drivers taught me valuable skills 
                    that deepened my passion for engineering and prepared me for future projects in robotics and automation.

                    BOGOCHIB is a Python-based simulation that replicates the fascinating collective behavior 
                    of bird flocks within a 2D environment. Developed as a project in computational modeling, 
                    the program showcases realistic bird behaviors like <strong>alignment</strong>, <strong>cohesion</strong>, 
                    <strong>separation</strong>, and <strong>predator avoidance</strong>, providing a visual representation 
                    of how simple rules followed by individual birds can lead to complex, emergent behaviors. The simulation 
                    also allows for dynamic user interaction, such as adjusting the number of birds or introducing a predator.
                    
                    The simulation was built using <strong>Python</strong> and the <strong>Pygame library</strong> for rendering 
                    and interaction. It integrates features like periodic boundaries for birds,  and dynamic UI components for 
                    real-time adjustments.

                    Working on this project introduced me to essential concepts in computational behavior modeling, 
                    such as vector mathematics for motion, object-oriented design, and real-time simulation rendering. 
                    Additionally, debugging interactions between birds and predators and optimizing the system for smoother
                     performance were challenging but rewarding experiences. This project helped deepen my understanding of 
                     how mathematical and computational principles can mimic natural phenomena in a digital environment.
